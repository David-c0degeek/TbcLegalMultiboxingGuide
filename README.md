## Why Dranei priests

In TBCC [Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=6346/fear-ward) has been changed and is now learnable by ALL priests, making Dwarf priest lose this massive advantage.  
On the other hand, Dranei Priests get [Symbol of Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=32548/symbol-of-hope) which is HANDS DOWN the best MP5 raid-wide in TBCC, and can be cast one AFTER the other (they CANNOT stack, and if you cast both at the same time its a waste, one wil override the other).

| Spell                | Total Mana Restored (est.) | Target     | CD      | Notes                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Symbol of Hope**   | \~8,325                    | 5 players  | 5 min   | **Party-wide**, high return   |
| Mana Tide Totem      | \~2,000‚Äì3,000              | 5 players  | 5 min   | Less overall, more passive    |
| Shadowfiend          | \~2,500‚Äì3,500              | Caster     | 5 min   | Single target, vulnerable pet |
| Innervate (baseline) | \~6,000‚Äì7,000+             | 1 target   | 6 min   | Very strong, but 1-person     |
| Vampiric Touch       | Varies with SPriest DPS    | Group-wide | Passive | Scales with damage dealt      |

## Why Gnome warlock and not Human

[Fel Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=28176/fel-armor) only benefits from Spirit in [WOTLK](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=28176/fel-armor), meaning in TBC, the flat intellect bonus (from [Expansive Mind](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=20591/expansive-mind)) of gnomes still beats anything else.

## üß™ Party Layout (for Heroic Presence + Totem Synergy)

To get the **maximum value** from Draenei racials and Shaman totems (which are **party-only** in TBC), split your team into the following **two optimized parties**:

### üõ° Party 1 ‚Äì Tank & Healer Group

* Focus: Survivability, sustain, stable mana pool
* Totems: Mana Tide, Cleansing, Tremor
* Utility: Earth Shield, Shadowfiend, Symbol of Hope

| Slot   | Class                    | Notes                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| üõ°     | **Protection Paladin**   | Aggro anchor, AoE tank, Blessings, Devotion Aura           |
| ‚ù§Ô∏è     | **Holy Paladin**         | Single-target healing powerhouse, backup dispels           |
| ‚ù§Ô∏è     | **Resto Shaman**         | Heroic Presence, Mana Tide, Earth Shield, Cleansing/Tremor |
| ‚öî      | **Beast Mastery Hunter** | Macro-simple, pet carries DPS, provides Trueshot Aura      |
| ‚öî / ‚ù§Ô∏è | **Shadow Priest**        | Returns mana to the group, Symbol of Hope, backup heals    |

üí° This group gains:

* ‚úî Full Heroic Presence (+1% Spell Hit)
* ‚úî Mana Tide Totem for all mana users
* ‚úî Tank Survive Stack: Earth Shield, Devotion Aura, Fortitude, BoK
* ‚úî Passive Regen: Vampiric Touch + Symbol of Hope
* ‚úî Trueshot Aura (though it's raid-wide, good spot for Hunter if simplicity is key)

---

### üéØ Party 2 ‚Äì DPS & Caster Group

* Focus: Max burst synergy, spell hit/crit stacking
* Totems: Totem of Wrath, Wrath of Air
* Utility: Curse of Elements, Moonkin Aura, Shadow Weaving

| Slot    | Class                   | Notes                                                                |
| ------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üßô      | **Arcane Mage**         | Arcane Intellect, massive burst, AOE control with Blizzard  |
| üêª / üõ° | **Boomkin Druid**       | Moonkin Aura (+5% spell crit), Mark of the Wild, off-tank capable    |
| üòà      | **Destruction Warlock** | Curse of Elements, Shadow Bolt spam, utility tools                   |
| ‚ö°       | **Elemental Shaman**    | Totem of Wrath, Heroic Presence, Bloodlust, DPS                      |
| üß†      | **Shadow Priest**       | Mana return, Symbol of Hope chain, Fear Ward, Shadow Weaving         |

üí° This group gains:

* ‚úî Totem of Wrath (+3% Spell Hit and Crit)
* ‚úî Moonkin Aura (+5% Crit for casters)
* ‚úî Heroic Presence (+1% Spell Hit)
* ‚úî Shadow Weaving + Curse of Elements: Amplifies Mage/Warlock/SP damage
* ‚úî Stacked MP5: Vampiric Touch, Symbol of Hope

---

‚úÖ This layout ensures:

* **at least 1 Draenei per party** for full *Heroic Presence* uptime
* **Totems are optimized**: Totem of Wrath buffs all casters, Mana Tide supports healers
* Logical role grouping: Tanks & heals together, DPS together
* Easier multibox macro management due to group symmetry

## üéØ Talent Build Recommendations (Visual)

> You can preview or copy these from Wowhead‚Äôs TBC Classic Talent Calculator

### üõ° Protection Paladin

* Focus on: **Righteous Fury, Holy Shield, Improved Righteousness**
* Take **Improved Devotion Aura** if not using Concentration Aura
[Prot Paladin Talents (0/49/12)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/paladin/-0530513350002102521551-050050002)

### üêª Feral Druid (Bear Tank spec / Boomkin Dual-Spec)

* Max out: **Thick Hide, Feral Instinct, Survival of the Fittest**
* Keep a macro to switch to DPS gear if off-tanking isn't needed
* [Boomkin Talents (43/0/18)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/druid/50032201250313523132--2500335)
* [Feral Bear Talents (Dual-Spec)(0/44/17)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/druid/-503032132322105301251-05503301)  

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Shadow Priest (Holy Priest Dual-Spec)

* Go deep into **Holy**: **Spiritual Healing, Divine Fury, Circle of Healing** optional for massive aoe
[Holy Priest Talents (20/41/0)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/priest/50023011305-235050032002150520051)  

* alternatively, go IDS spec for caster benefits [**PREFFERED** due to heavy caster team]
[Holy Priest Talents Improved Divine Spirit (23/38/0)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/priest/500230113050012-23405003030215052003)

* shadow build listed below

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Holy Paladin

* Full **Holy**: **Holy Guidance, Divine Illumination**, skip Protection tree
[Holy Paladin Talents (45/11/0)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/paladin/05503121520132531051-500231-5)

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Resto Shaman

* Prioritize: **Tidal Mastery, Nature's Swiftness, Mana Tide Totem**
[Resto Shaman Talents (0/5/56)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/shaman/-5-55235051355311510321)

### ‚öî Elemental Shaman

* Full **Elemental**: **Lightning Mastery, Elemental Fury, Totem of Wrath**
[Elemental Shaman Talents (47/0/14)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/shaman/55003155000215351051--05005301)

### ‚öî BM Hunter

* Deep **Beast Mastery**: **Serpent‚Äôs Swiftness, Bestial Wrath**, high pet uptime
[BM Hunter Talents (44/5/12)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/hunter/552000005052122531051-05-33310002)

### ‚öî Arcane Mage

* This build is similar to the standard Arcane Mage build, with a slight difference, instead of focusing on single target frost talents, which a lot of the high end mages don't require since they barely press Frostbolt - you can focus on control, which in some niche situations in raids can be the difference between wiping or not. It does so by using Permafrost combined with Improved Blizzard instead of Piercing Ice.

* If you've got proper support from your raid then this spec is worth thinking about. It's also incredibly strong in heroic dungeons making you one of the most useful classes for that content with AoE slows with hard cc from Polymorph, plus insanely high burst damage for bosses.
[Arcane Mage Talents (40/0/21)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/mage/2500050310130150330125--053500301300001)

### ‚öî Destruction Warlock

* Go **Destruction** with **Shadow-based talents** if pairing with SPriest
[Shadow Destro Warlock (7/11/43)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/warlock/50002-2050030001-555020500200510031351)

### ‚öî Shadow Priest

* Straight **Shadow**: **Shadow Weaving, Vampiric Touch, Darkness**
[Shadow Priest Talents (13/0/48)](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/talent-calc/priest/550000003--503250210250123051551)

## üïπ Macro-Simple Rotations

Note - These macros are the BASE start, the MINIMAL needed.
Work / expand from here.

### üîÅ Simple DPS Macros

* **Ele Shaman**: `Chain Lightning ‚Üí Lightning Bolt x2` ‚Äì 1-button loop
* **Hunter**: `Steady Shot + /petattack` ‚Äî passive auto attack spam
* **Shadow Priest**: `VT ‚Üí SW:P ‚Üí Mind Flay`
* **Arcane Mage**: `Arcane Blast`
* **Warlock**: `Curse of Elements ‚Üí Shadow Bolt spam`

### üõ° Protection Paladin Macro

NOTE: For optimal performance/survivability in challenging content, manual upkeep of Holy Shield and appropriate Seals (Wisdom for mana, Righteousness/Command for threat) would be beneficial

```c
#showtooltip
/castsequence reset=target/combat Judgement, Consecration
/startattack
```

### ‚öî Elemental Shaman Macro

```c
#showtooltip
/castsequence reset=target/combat Chain Lightning, Lightning Bolt, Lightning Bolt
```

### üßô Arcane Mage Macro

```c
#showtooltip Arcane Blast
/cast Arcane Blast
```

```

### ü¶Å BM Hunter Macro

### ‚ùå Why Not These

| Spec/Class      | Why Skipped                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enhance Shaman  | Strong melee, but violates no-melee rule                  |
| Survival Hunter | Great buff, but BM more multibox-friendly                 |
| Demo Warlock    | 10% SP buff, but Destruction + SPriest gives more DPS     |
| CoH Priest      | Optional, but IDS is stronger for multiboxing consistency |
| Dwarf Priest    | Lost Fear Ward monopoly in TBC                            |

---

## üéÆ Multibox Tips

* Keep rotations **as symmetrical as possible** for DPS
* Use **/assist focus** on your Paladin tank for all DPS macros
* Use **FTL (Focusless, Targetless, Leaderless)** multibox style if advanced
* For **movement-heavy fights**, pre-place pets/totems to reduce repositioning
* Sync up **Bloodlusts**: Resto and Elemental can rotate casts across pulls

---

## üèÅ Summary

This team is:

* üîí **Stable**
* üß† **Buff-rich**
* üîÅ **Simple to control**
* üí£ **Capable of clearing Karazhan, heroics, 10-man content**

You're covering every essential buff/debuff, while keeping input and maintenance low.
